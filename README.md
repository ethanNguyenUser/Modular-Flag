# Modular-Flag
A scalable American flag JApplet

Features: 
 - Draws American flag
 - True RGB colors
 - Can scale in size through user input into the console
 - Can also scale through window-resizing
 - Flag remains proportional so that it does not get clipped by the smallest window dimension
 - Has a Quit option to terminate the program
 - Minimum flag scale set at 87 to prevent the stars of the flag from disappearing due to how they would be less than one pixel wide
